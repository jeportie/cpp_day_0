Below is an analysis of the code reviews and the issues discovered in the projects.

─────────────────────────────

1. Contact Class Field Typo (ex01)
  • In Contact.class.hpp, the member variable "_fistName" is almost certainly a typo that should be "_firstName."  
  • Although this may not cause a runtime error, it can lead to confusion and misalignment with getter/setter names or other parts of the code that expect consistent naming.

2. Inefficient Contact Update in PhoneBook (ex01)
  • In PhoneBook::addContact(), a temporary copy “current” is created from the static _contacts array using modulus indexing.  
  • The contact is updated via setContactInfo and then immediately copied back into _contacts — an unnecessary copy if _contacts can be manipulated directly.  
  • This not only is less efficient but also may be error-prone if the copy constructor or assignment operator is not properly defined.
  • Refactoring to operate directly on _contacts[_arrIndex % 8] would simplify the code.

3. Withdrawal Transaction Order and Restoration in Account (ex02)
  • In Account::makeWithdrawal(), the withdrawal amount is deducted before validating if the account has sufficient funds.
  • If the remaining balance is negative, the code then restores the initial amount (p_amount), which can be error-prone.  
  • A better solution would be to test if Account::_amount is sufficient before performing the deduction.  
  • This bug, if triggered, could allow an overdraft that is then “rolled back” (and might lead to additional side effects if other state updates occur in between).

─────────────────────────────

4. Over-Complex String Space Handling (ex00)
  • The function strCheckSpace() in utils.cpp likely has more complexity than needed given its purpose (i.e., handling string spaces).  
  • Simplifying the logic could improve readability and maintainability, and—if performance is a concern—may also offer speed improvements.
  • Consider refactoring using standard library functions (e.g., std::isspace and iterators) to streamline the process.
  • Even if the current solution works as intended, readability is key for maintenance.

Below is a concise table summarizing the issues, proposed solutions, and risk assessments:

| Issue                                             | Proposed Solution                                                              | Risk Assessment    |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Typo in Contact field (_fistName instead of _firstName) | Rename variable to _firstName for clarity and consistency                     | 🔴 Low risk        |
| Unnecessary copying in PhoneBook::addContact()    | Update _contacts array in place rather than copying to a temporary object      | 🔶 Medium risk     |
| Withdrawal deduction order in Account::makeWithdrawal() | Validate sufficient funds before deduction to avoid complex rollback logic     | 🔴 High risk       |
| Over-complexity in strCheckSpace()                | Refactor to use standard library functions and simplify logic                  | 🔶 Low risk        |
